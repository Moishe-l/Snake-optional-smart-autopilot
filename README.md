# Snake-optional-smart-autopilot
A snake game with an option to allow the game to play itself. Before turning, it calculates the closest direction to the dot and will use the other direction if the closer way will cause it to hit itself and get out. Additionally, it will turn out of the way when about to hit itself and turn in the direction that will allow it to be furthest away from itself.
